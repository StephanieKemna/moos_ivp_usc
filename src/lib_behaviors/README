To use the dynamic loading of these behaviors, you need to add them to the
IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIRS environment variable:

for bashrc:
export IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIRS=${MOOSIVP_USC_HOME}/src/lib_behaviors:${IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIRS}

This assumes you already set the MOOSIVP_USC_HOME environment variable when
installing (after building) your moos-ivp-usc tree.

Note, that, in order for this to work, pHelmIvP needs to be able to find the
bhv source code in this directory. It does not search subdirectories.
