To use the dynamic loading of these behaviors, you need to add them to the
IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIRS environment variable:

for bashrc:
export IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIRS=${MOOSIVP_USC_HOME}/lib:${IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIRS}

which tells pHelmIvP where to find the bhv library .so files.

This assumes you already set the MOOSIVP_USC_HOME environment variable when
installing (after building) your moos-ivp-usc tree.
