This folder was made for the specific use of running AUV experiments for the
human-AUV path planning experiments, Summer'17 with Sara Kangaslahti

To run this simulation (assuming you have installed & compiled everything etc):

In a terminal tab:
$ ./launch.sh <options>

To start vehicle:
- click on the DEPLOY ALL button

You should see the AUV start going to a waypoint pattern.
(You can use the arrow keys to move in the pMarineViewer window, i/o to zoom in/out)
